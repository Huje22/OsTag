## Some informations
* If the configuration was not generated, use the plugin description
* If you can't set something Indian will probably help you (write on discord)
* I don't recomend building jar from this code , i recomend download latest version from releases , if in releases not contains version  that would be compatible with the pom.xml version, I do not recommend building it this means that a new version is already in the works, but this may not always be the case, but if you need you can try to build it yourself
